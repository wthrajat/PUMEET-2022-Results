# What is this?
See description

# How to use this?
1. Install Selenium ``pip install selenium`` and Browser Webdriver [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_drivers/) 

2. Put Chrome Webdriver's executable path in the path variable

    (Note that in Windows you need to include ``filename.exe`` in the path also)

3. Sit back and run the script.
4. (Optional)(For Better Understanding) Print to the console or use Pandas library to import this to a python list or whatever to sort it according to the rank.
(I have a sorted version, Yes we want)

# Why made this?
Many people wanted to see the Marks vs Rank data for this year's PUMEET, so...
Also this is me getting bored and pissed off due to high competition.
